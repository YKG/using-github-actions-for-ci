## Step 8: Target a Windows environment

Since we'd like to support deploying our app to Windows environments, let's add Windows to the matrix build configuration. 

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit your workflow file to build for Windows environments

You can follow the suggestion, or manually make the changes in the numbered instructions.

```suggestion
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-2016]
        node-version: [8.x, 10.x]
```

1. Edit the workflow config at [`.github/workflows/node.js.yml`]({{ fileUrl }})
2. Add an `os` field to the `strategy.matrix` section of your workflow
3. Add `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-2016` to the target operating systems
4. Commit your workflow changes to this branch.

I'll respond in this pull request when you've committed.
